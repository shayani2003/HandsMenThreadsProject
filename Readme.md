**Description:**  
When the order status is updated from *Pending* to *Confirmed*, the flow triggers an **email confirmation** to the customer with order details.

### 2️⃣ Low Alert Flow
**Description:**  
Automatically monitors product stock levels.  
If the quantity drops below a predefined threshold, a **Low Stock Alert** email is sent to the inventory manager.
